**Website:** *(To be decided)*

## Overview
I’ve always been excited by the idea of chatting with a computer through a simple terminal. So I thought: *“Why not bring that old-school, text-based feeling right into my personal website?”* It adds a fun and unique vibe, different from the usual look and feel. I also added some fun comamnds if you want to try them out, hopefully it's not _too_ buggy. 🤓

I also wanted to make my site more playful by adding a game. But some friends pointed out that not everyone—especially recruiters—wants to play a game just to learn about me. They might prefer a quick and easy way to check out my work. So, I decided to give them a choice. If you’re feeling adventurous, go for the game mode and have some fun. If not, you can stick to a straightforward layout that shows my projects and background at a glance. 🎮💻

My goal is to offer both a classic, interactive experience and a simple, direct way to get to know me. That way, no matter what kind of visitor you are—you’ll get to know all about me on my site. ✨
