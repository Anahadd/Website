\section*{Overview}
I’ve always been fascinated by the idea of interacting with a computer through a terminal. When it came time to build my own personal website, I thought: \textit{why not bring that terminal-like feel to the web?} This idea stemmed from my love for command-line interfaces and the unique way they engage the user.

At the same time, I had the itch to incorporate a game into my site—something fun and interactive. However, friends advised me that recruiters and other visitors might find a full-fledged game cumbersome when all they want is quick, easy access to information.

To strike a balance, I decided to offer the best of both worlds. Visitors can choose how they’d like to experience my website. If they prefer simplicity and efficiency, they can explore a static, straightforward layout that showcases my background, skills, and projects. For those feeling adventurous, there’s an optional, playful mode that simulates a terminal environment, offering a more hands-on and engaging experience. This way, my site can cater to both the no-nonsense professional and the curious tinkerer alike.

\section*{Key Points}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Terminal-Style Interface:} Drawing inspiration from command-line tools, offering a nostalgic and interactive user experience.
    \item \textbf{Optional Gameplay:} An integrated, game-like mode for those who want to explore a more engaging, interactive version of the site.
    \item \textbf{Flexible Experience:} Users can select between a straightforward, static site or the more experimental, interactive terminal mode.
\end{itemize}
